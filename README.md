# Dynamic Programming
DP is optimised recursion.

**Identification:**
1. Identifications of recursion ie. choices and decisions.
2. Optimal value is asked. Keywords like maximum, minimum, optimal is used.

**Identification of Knapsack Problems:**
- choices is present
- wt[] is given
- val[] may be present
- W(capacity) is given

**Variations of Knapsack:**
1. Subset Sum
2. Equal Sum Partition
3. Count of Subset sum
4. Minimum subset off
5. Target Sum
6. "#" of subset c given d/f
